# 404 Tests

These tests target the API endpoint GET /channels/nhsapp/accounts testing that 404 is returned when a page does not exist


## Scenario: An API consumer submitting a GET NHS App Accounts request with a page that does not exist

**Given** the API consumer sends a request to get NHS App Accounts with a valid ODS code and a page that does not exist
<br/>
**When** the request is submitted
<br/>
**Then** the service responds with a 404 not found response, telling the user the resource does not exist
<br/>

**Asserts**
- Response returns a 404 ‘Not Found’ error
- Response returns the expected error message body
- Response returns the ‘X-Correlation-Id’ header if provided

**Correlation IDs**

This test uses the ‘X-Correlation-Id’ header, when provided in a request it is returned in the response.
