  ### Sandbox

  It is possible to trigger some of the errors in the sandbox by sending the header `Authorization` with certain values.

  Here is an example curl request to trigger a `CM_CANNOT_SET_ODS_CODE`:

    curl -X POST \
      --header "Accept: */*" \
      --header "Content-type: application/vnd.api+json" \
      --header "Authorization: noOdsChange" \
      -d '{"data":{"type":"MessageBatch","attributes":{"routingPlanId":"b838b13c-f98c-4def-93f0-515d4e4f4ee1","messageBatchReference":"346e3fc3-0b55-4c0d-bec9-0cc5aa431836","messages":[{"messageReference":"da0b1495-c7cb-468c-9d81-07dee089d728","recipient":{"nhsNumber":"9990548609"},"originator":{"odsCode":"X123"},"personalisation":{}}]}}}' \
