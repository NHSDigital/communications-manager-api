  The channel and supplier status callback sends POST requests to your service with real time updates when the status of a channel or supplier has changed.

  This is an automated way to get the status of each channel used in a routing plan.

  ### Deciding which message status callbacks to receive
  It's your organisation or service's responsibility to decide which statuses to receive callbacks for.

  You may need to subscribe to a combination of channel and supplier statuses if you:

  - want to send your own fallback messages based on specific statuses
  - need to know exactly how a message has performed in real time with each of your recipients
  - need to know what happened to a message sent using a <a href="https://notify.nhs.uk/using-nhs-notify/routing-plans#secondary-cascades" target="_new">secondary cascade (opens in a new tab)
