    Message status callbacks send POST requests to your service with real time updates when the status of a message has changed.

    This is an automated way to get the status of messages.

    If you're onboarding with NHS Notify and need to use the channel and supplier status callback, contact the onboarding team to tell them what statuses you want to subscribe to.

    If you're live with NHS Notify and need to use the channel and supplier status callback, [raise a Service Now ticket](https://nhsdigitallive.service-now.com/csm).

    ### Deciding which message status callbacks to receive

    It's your organisation or service's responsibility to decide which statuses to receive callbacks for.
    
    The message status callbacks are typically used for finding out if a recipient has been contacted with any of the channels in a routing plan.
    
    For example, if you only want updating when your patients have been contacted and do not need updating when each message channel was used, choose the `delivered` and `failed` message statuses.
    
    If you need additional real time updates when the status of a channel changes, you can also use the channel and supplier status callback.
