              This is the routing plan you wish your message to be sent with. The values available to you for this are setup during your [onboarding process](#overview--onboarding).

              There are also some global routingPlanIds available, please see the [Free-text communications documentation](#section/Free-text-communications).

              If you send through an invalid routing plan id you will receive a 404 response.

              This is a client-supplied unique reference for this message.

              This value is used internally to de-duplicate messages. If you send the same value through multiple times only one of the requests will be actioned.
