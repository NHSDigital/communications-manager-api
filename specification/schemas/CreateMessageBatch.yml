              This is the routing plan you wish your batch to use whilst sending messages to the recipients. The values available to you for this are setup during your [onboarding process](#overview--onboarding).

              If you send through an invalid routing plan you will receive a 404 response.

              This is a client-supplied unique reference for this batch of messages.

              This value is used internally to de-duplicate batches. If you send the same value through multiple times only one of the requests will be actioned.
